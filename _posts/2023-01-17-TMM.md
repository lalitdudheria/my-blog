This was the first time I was going for TMM. Had been reading about it for a few years and finally got a chance this time to go for it. Just jotting down everything here in the form of bullets so that I can relive it again. Readers might not necessarily enjoy this form of writing. 

- The weather was excellent. (very close to Bangalore)
- Went there with a couple of friends who run. 
- Stayed at Hotel Anam International on Grant road. The location was good but the hotel was okayish. 
- Enjoyed chai, bun maska and vada pav as breakfast. 
- Loved the Kaali Peeli taxis of Mumbai. I wish  getting a cab was this easy in Delhi and Bangalore. 
- The Bib Collection was fire. Should have a gone a day earlier so that I could have enjoyed it better but nonetheless it was good. 
- Bought this beautiful medal hanger for me and my wife. 
- The New York Cheese Cake at Spesso is a must try. Went there again just for that.
- Pizza at Pizza by the bay and Ice cream at K Rustom. Please do try them.  
- Nariman Point was so much fun. Sat there for an hour with friends. 

# Now talking about the race day. 
- The event was totally lit. 
- Never have seen an event with such high energy. People from all age groups ready to rock.
- I literally had goosebumps while running on sea link. It was such a beauty. My heart was smiling the whole time I ran on it. 
- The management was good except for the medal collection. 
- There were people from every age group along the road to cheer us and help us hydrate and give us the energy we need by offering us biscuits, oranges, energy drinks. You just cannot give up when they are cheering you. 
- I completed my half marathon in 2:55 hours. The time was way more than I expected but a few good things happened. 
    - I was not tired mentally. 
    - My cardio vascular system was still in a good shape at the end. 
    - Average heart rate during the run was 163 which is good considering the past runs. 
- But my knees and ankles gave up after 15th km. 
- My wife had her personal best for 10K. 
- My heart was full  the end and I had a great time. Will come again and this time better prepared. 
- Thank you Tata and thank you Mumbai for such an amazing time. See you in 2024
